This is the first version of our Micromouse which secured 2nd position in Conscientia 2024 Technical Fest at Indian Institute of Space Science And Technology.
In this version we used the Arduino Framework to code an ESP32 board. A rotary encoder was used along with N20 motors and equipped with PID for precise control. IR sensors were used on front, right and left side for detcting walls. The bot was built using two zero PCBs stacked on each other. We powered the bot using a 11.1v 350mAh LiPo battery through a Voltage Regulator(Arduino Nano).
Floodfill algorithm was employed for path planning.
This code is for a 12x12 maze but we can use it for any even sized square shaped grid.
